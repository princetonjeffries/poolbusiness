                <p>Me and my buddies spent our summer days swimming in pools for hours on end. We loved the water, and wanted to bring the joy that we had to everyone else. I founded this company back in 2011, and haven't looked back since. Building and remodeling pools has brought me joy I never thought I could experience. Seeing the look on our client's faces after our job is done is something you can't put a price on.</p>

                <p>Growing up in New York, we didn't get much time to swim around in pools in the summer. It was not very common to have one in your backyard. Once I moved to Arizona, I fell in love with pools. I spent most of my summer days as a kid swimming in the water. This is where my passion for pools began. I promise to help you get the pool you want, because in the end, everyone needs a great pool.</p>

                <p>Being born in Canada brought me great joy, I take pride in being a canadian. However, one flaw to that was that It was very cold there, and we did not get to experience the common household pool like we have in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona I was stunned; Summers were filled with pool parties and It was the best time I've ever had. I want to bring that same joy to our clients. Invest in our service and I can promise satisfaction.</p>
